# per-component section each. Members are every launch-dir sibling carrying .atlas.conf
# — self-describing, so a repo wired later joins with no settings edit. On a
# single-repo desktop the launch dir is the repo and the seat is just this component.
# (A 4-repo seat paid ~84KB per session start, 71% of it the same text four times —
# arc-platform finding, 2026-09-03.)
