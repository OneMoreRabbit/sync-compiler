# AGENTS.md — Atlas hook

This repo is the **sync-compile** component of AgentEco, governed by Architecture-Above-Code.
The architecture lives in the project's Atlas vault — a git repo resolved by
`scripts/atlas-sync.sh` into `$ATLAS_VAULT` (default `./.atlas`), at the method version
pinned in the vault's `registry/io-graph.yml`. Never reference the vault by a machine path.

**Before working:** read `ATLAS-CONTEXT.md` — injected by the SessionStart hook on every
session start (including resume, `/clear`, compaction and fork). Regenerate any time with
`sh scripts/atlas-context.sh`. **If it is absent, your hooks are not live** — the write
guard is not running either. Fix the install (`atlas_init --launch-dir`, then `--verify`);
until then honour the write scope by hand. It is your complete reading list: constitution, pinned
upstream contracts, consumers' needs, in-flight proposals, drift. Consult the wider vault
only if the context is insufficient — and treat that as a defect in the vault's
`registry/io-graph.yml`: fix the graph, don't browse.

**While working:** you may write only to `components/sync-compile/**`, an additive
`architecture/proposals/NNNN-*.md`, and edges in `registry/io-graph.yml` that name you.
A `PreToolUse` guard refuses anything else. That is not an obstacle to route around: if you
need something owned elsewhere, ask for it in `components/sync-compile/docs/needs/`.

**After working:** run `/atlas-publish` (contracts to provides/, asks to needs/, ADRs for
shared changes, bump `updated:`, recompile as a check, commit authored files only on
`atlas/sync-compile/<topic>`, open the PR).
