# AGENTS.md — Atlas hook

This repo is the **sync-compile** component of AgentEco, governed by Architecture-Above-Code.
The architecture lives in the project's Atlas vault — a git repo resolved by
`scripts/atlas-sync.sh` into `$ATLAS_VAULT` (default `./.atlas`), at the method version
pinned in the vault's `registry/io-graph.yml`. Never reference the vault by a machine path.

**Before working:** read `ATLAS-CONTEXT.md` — injected by the SessionStart hook on every
session start (including resume, `/clear` and compaction). Regenerate any time with
`sh scripts/atlas-context.sh`. **If it is absent, your hooks are not live** — the write
guard is not running either. Fix the install (`atlas_init --launch-dir`, then `--verify`);
until then honour the write scope by hand. It is your complete reading list: constitution, pinned
upstream contracts, consumers' needs, in-flight proposals, drift. Consult the wider vault
only if the context is insufficient — and treat that as a defect in the vault's
`registry/io-graph.yml`: fix the graph, don't browse.

**The development cycle** — every piece of work runs this loop, in order:
1. **Review architecture** — constitution and the architecture-in-force index in your briefing.
2. **Examine your edges** — the contracts under *Inputs* are what you build AGAINST, and
   your consumers' *needs* are what you owe. Read them, don't scroll past them. Code that
   contradicts a pinned contract is a defect even if every test passes.
3. **Develop.**
4. **Test.**
5. **Update your own `provides/` and `needs/`** — what changed for consumers, what you
   now need from providers — and publish. The Stop guard checks this step.

Two rules bind every step: **confirm the issue before you build it** (never develop
against an assumed problem), and **test against the real environment and its real
upstream contracts — never an invented fixture.** A green test over a fiction is not
evidence.

**Your mode** is in `.atlas.conf` (`ATLAS_MODE`, default **supervised**). *Supervised*:
state the issue and approach and get the operator's OK before developing; publishing or
releasing (push, PR, tag) will pause for their approval — do not work around it.
*Autonomous*: run the full cycle and publish through the write model; oversight is the
cascade and the hub. **House style, always:** plain English, concise; use the method's
existing terms, coin none; say less.

**While working:** you may write only to `components/sync-compile/**`, an additive
`architecture/proposals/NNNN-*.md`, and edges in `registry/io-graph.yml` that name you.
A `PreToolUse` guard refuses anything else. That is not an obstacle to route around: if you
need something owned elsewhere, ask for it in `components/sync-compile/docs/needs/`.

**After working:** run `/atlas-publish` (contracts to provides/, asks to needs/, ADRs for
shared changes, bump `updated:`, recompile as a check, commit authored files only on
`atlas/sync-compile/<topic>`, open the PR).
